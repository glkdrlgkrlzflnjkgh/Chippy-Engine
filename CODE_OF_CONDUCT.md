welcome to the chippy engine offical repo!




here are the rules of helping out making this engine!


RULE #1: please do not make changes to the main.yml file in the workflows folder, as that needs to stay the same

RULE #2: keep the discussions on the discussions tab *friendly*

RULE #3: making a PR* that contains malicous changes will end up with any further PRs from you being rejected


*PR means pull request
